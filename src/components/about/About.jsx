        <p>Hello! My name is Connor McCrory and I'm a Web Developer, who specialized in: JavaScript, ReactJS, HTML, CSS, and NodeJS. I enjoy Web Development because it combines thinking while not taking away from being creative. When I'm not working, you can find me: on my computer learning, talking, playing, or anything sports; gaming with my friends, or outside paddle boarding, or anything to enjoy the outdoors.</p>
